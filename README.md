# WhosTheGoodDoggo
Who's the good doggo is a web app that's meant to make the life of dogs (especially stray dogs) a bit easier
My motive for this web app is to help dogs live an easier life than they are currently living.
What this app does is pretty simple it registers the dog is the database  and generated a QR code for each dog which can be attached to the dog's collar
This QR code can be scanned through either your phone's inbuilt scanner or one from the website itself to identify the dog and his/her info.
I am trying to keep this open source and my vision for this is an app that will be like Wikipedia meaning that I'll trust the users to input correct info and to correct the wrong info about dogs
This concept will be better suited for as mobile app but I doubt people will install this so this is my attempt to make concept ready throug web app and if it is a hit I'll code it as an mobile app
